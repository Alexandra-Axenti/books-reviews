# books-reviews

Main Goals

* The book will have many ratings.
* Rating and comments for each book.
* Use a helper to display nicely formatted timestamps, and/or represent ratings visually (ie: display stars, or thumbs up/thumbs down).
* Include at least one computed property.
* Use a service to allow users to create a list of â€œfavorite books".
* There should be an option to add new books to review. This can either be an admin-style page, or something available to all users.
